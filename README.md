![download](https://github.com/veerendra06/Email_Address_Validation/assets/141849906/10945428-f178-4b78-b30e-760189544782)

This Python script is designed to validate email addresses. It checks if a given email address is in a valid format, following common email address conventions. This can be useful in applications where you want to ensure that users provide valid email addresses for communication or registration purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before running this script, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the `email_validation.py` file to your local machine.

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/email-validation.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing `email_validation.py` using the command line.

   ```shell
   cd email-validation
   ```

3. Run the script, providing an email address as an argument. For example:

   ```shell
   python email_validation.py user@example.com
   ```

   Replace `user@example.com` with the email address you want to validate.

4. The script will then validate the email address and provide the result. If the email address is valid, it will display a success message. If it's not valid, it will display an error message.

## Example

```shell
python email_validation.py user@example.com
```

Output:
```
The email address 'user@example.com' is valid.
```

```shell
python email_validation.py invalid-email
```

Output:
```
Invalid email address: 'invalid-email'.
```
